# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a lightweight, CPU-optimized document intelligence system that extracts and prioritizes document sections based on persona relevance and job requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` for robust text extraction with page-level granularity
- **Section Segmentation**: Employs pattern-based section detection using headers, formatting cues, and semantic markers
- **Content Normalization**: Cleans and structures extracted text for downstream processing

### 2. Semantic Understanding Engine
- **Lightweight Embeddings**: Utilizes `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (22MB model) for efficient semantic representations
- **CPU Optimization**: Implements batch processing and caching to meet sub-60-second processing constraints
- **Relevance Scoring**: Combines cosine similarity with persona-specific weighting

### 3. Persona-Driven Ranking System
- **Query Construction**: Synthesizes persona role and job requirements into unified search queries
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Balances semantic relevance, section importance, and job-specific keywords
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Dynamically adjusts relevance thresholds based on document collection characteristics

### 4. Intelligent Section Refinement
- **Content Distillation**: Extracts key sentences using keyword matching and semantic clustering
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains document provenance and structural relationships
- **Output Optimization**: Formats results for immediate actionability by the target persona

### Scalability Features
- **Generic Architecture**: Domain-agnostic processing pipeline adaptable to diverse document types
- **Configurable Personas**: JSON-driven persona definitions supporting varied professional roles
- **Extensible Output**: Structured JSON format enabling integration with downstream applications

This approach ensures reliable, fast, and accurate document intelligence across diverse domains while maintaining strict computational constraints.
